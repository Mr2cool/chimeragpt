        prompt: `You are a world-class AI architect specializing in multi-agent systems. Your task is to design a high-level conceptual architecture for a **new, unified framework** that can handle multi-agent deployment, communication protocols, and collaboration.

The user has a specific goal for their system. Your design should be tailored to that goal.

**User's Goal:**
{{{goal}}}

**Available Technologies:**
You should consider how the following existing frameworks and protocols could be integrated or drawn upon as inspiration for your new framework design. Do not simply list them; explain how their concepts can be woven into a cohesive new architecture.
${knownFrameworks.map(f => `- **${f.name}:** ${f.description}`).join('\n')}

**Architectural Proposal Requirements:**
Your output must be a markdown document that outlines the proposed architecture. It must include the following sections:

1.  **## Conceptual Overview**
    *   Provide a high-level vision for the new framework.
    *   Name the new framework (e.g., "SynergyForge", "AgentWeaver", etc.).
    *   Explain the core principles of your design (e.g., modularity, scalability, interoperability).

2.  **## Core Components**
    *   Describe the key components of your proposed framework. Examples might include:
        *   **Agent Core:** The basic building block of an agent.
        *   **Deployment Engine:** How agents are instantiated and managed.
        *   **Communication Bus:** The protocol and mechanism for inter-agent communication (drawing inspiration from A2A/AP2).
        *   **Orchestration Layer:** How tasks are assigned and workflows are managed (drawing inspiration from CrewAI/LangGraph).
        *   **Shared Memory & State Management:** How agents share information and maintain state (drawing inspiration from Mem0/Dolt).
        *   **Tool & Service Integration:** How agents access external tools and APIs (drawing inspiration from LiteLLM).

3.  **## Communication Protocol**
    *   Propose a communication protocol for the agents.
    *   Detail the message structure (e.g., header, payload, sender, receiver).
    *   Explain how it ensures security and interoperability, referencing AP2 for commercial applications if relevant.

4.  **## Example Workflow**
    *   Based on the user's goal, walk through a step-by-step example of how a task would be executed within your proposed framework.
    *   Describe how different agents would be instantiated, communicate, and collaborate to achieve the goal.

5.  **## Integration Strategy**
    *   Briefly explain how this new, unified framework could act as a meta-framework, potentially wrapping or interfacing with existing frameworks like LangGraph or CrewAI where beneficial, rather than reinventing every wheel.

Your response should be detailed, professional, and well-structured, providing the user with a clear and inspiring blueprint for their project.
